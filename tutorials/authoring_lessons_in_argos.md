## Structuring Courses in Argos

In Argos, courses are built using a structured system of containers: **Units**, **Modules**, **Sections**, and **Pages**. Each of these containers serves a specific role in organizing your content. A well-organized course breaks down complex information into smaller, manageable segments, helping students progress smoothly through the material.

- **Units** act as broad categories or themes, covering major topics in your course. Think of a Unit as a folder that groups related content.
- **Modules** are subdivisions within Units, breaking down broader topics into smaller chunks. Each module should focus on a sub-topic of the Unit’s overarching theme.
- **Sections** are optional but can further subdivide Modules when needed, giving additional organizational layers.
- **Pages** are where you will present the actual course content—this includes instructional text, multimedia elements, and assessments.

Argos provides a **breadcrumb navigation** at the top of each page, which shows the path from the current page up through its parent containers. This helps both you and your students understand where you are within the course structure and allows for easy navigation between different parts of the course.

You can also customize the labels used for these containers to match the terminology of your discipline or institution. For example, you might prefer to use "Chapters" instead of "Modules". To do this, navigate to your project settings and edit the **Project Labels** accordingly.

### Practical Steps for Setting Up Course Structure:

1. **Create a New Course**: Once logged into Argos, navigate to the project dashboard and click on **"Create New Project"**.
   - Enter a **descriptive course name** (e.g., "Introduction to Biology") and click **"Create"**.

2. **Set Up Your Course Containers**: Navigate to the **Curriculum** view where you can start adding your Units, Modules, and Pages.
   - **Add a Unit**: Click **"Add Unit"** to create a new overarching topic (e.g., "Unit 1: Basics of Biology").
   - **Add a Module**: Click into the Unit you just created and select **"Add Module"**. A module could focus on a sub-topic like "Cell Structure".
   - **Add a Page**: Once in a Module, click **"Add Page"**. Pages contain your actual content and assessments. For example, a page in the “Cell Structure” module could be titled "Animal vs. Plant Cells".

This layered structure makes it easy to organize your course while ensuring that content is logically segmented. A large course might include multiple Units, each containing several Modules and Pages.

## Creating and Managing Learning Objectives

Learning objectives define what learners should achieve by the end of a lesson, module, or course. They help focus your content and provide a clear measure of success. In Argos, you can create learning objectives and tag them to your content and assessments, ensuring alignment throughout your course.

**How to Create and Use Learning Objectives:**

1. **Navigate to Learning Objectives**: In the **Create** menu, select **"Objectives"**.

2. **Add a New Objective**:
   - Click **"Add Objective"** and write out your learning goal.
   - Example: "Understand the fundamentals of cellular biology".

3. **Add Sub-Objectives** (optional):
   - Click **"Add Sub-Objective"** under each learning objective to add more specific targets.
   - Example: "Differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells".

4. **Tag Learning Objectives to Content and Assessments**:
   - When editing a page or an assessment question, look for the **"Objectives"** section.
   - Select relevant objectives from the list to associate them with the content or question.

By tagging objectives throughout the course, Argos can track student progress toward specific learning outcomes. This data is then available to instructors, helping them understand which areas students are mastering and where they may need additional support.
